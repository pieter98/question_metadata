        "#### Basis for built-in topic classification of exam questions\n",
        "The huggingface pipeline is ideal for our use case: we want to add useful, predefined topic metadata to our exam questions. E.g. a user of the AssessmentQ platform creates a new exam question, we pass the question text to the zero-shot pipeline along with predefined topics (these topics are based on the sector of the client: Mathematics, Chemistry, ... for example). The pipeline then gives us the topic label(s) with the highest likelihood. User feedback would be possible, we give the user our prediction and the user indicates if the prediction is correct or not, if not the user gives us the correct label. This way we can build a correctly labeled dataset for further AI projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Generate training data\n",
        "Another use case for the zero-shot pipeline is to directly use the zero-shot predictions to generate a labeled dataset. In this case we only take labels that are the most likely to be correct (with a high probability). E.g. let's take all label predictions with a probability above 85% and consider them to be true.\n",
